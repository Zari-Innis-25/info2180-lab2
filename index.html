            Art from the early ages has been used as a tool of expression, whether through music , photography or drawing . However, in today's world of artistry , art is no longer limited to soft strokes of a pen or pencil on paper. Digital art is becoming the new norm in the art scene. With apps like Procreate, Ibis Paint, Photoshop ect., people have found ways to express their artistic passions digitally, allowing people worldwide to appreciate artisans' work. What I personally love about digital art is its flexibility, reach, and cost effectiveness.

            As an artist who started drawing in traditional ways , digital art has combined my creativity with my passion for technology. By using rgb or hex colours, we can get exact colour matches and increase the vibrancy of our creations. In addition, digital art platforms usually are free or come at a small one time fee, whereas traditional methods like painting are costly, due frequent buying of supplies, like brushes, canvas, etc. This new cost effective way of bringing the imagination to life using technology , has even opened a new job market for digital art commissions like nfc’s. Consequently, making digital art a great 21st century art form.

        Art VS AI

            Personally, I have both a passion for coding as well as art. For some, coding is merely one’s and zero’s but is actually so much more. Coding has paved another way in the art field with AI. AI tools can be used to generate images, videos, animations, etc, to a moderate degree. Some however, may feel threatened by these tools. AI is seen to pose a threat to jobs surrounding the creativity sector, making human artists redundant. Contrarily to popular beliefs,I see AI as a way to fuse my passions. 
        </p>
        <p>
Instead of replacing artists for AI bots , artists can use these tools to enhance their visions , for eg. An artist can use AI to help visualize the anatomy of  certain poses needed for their piece or even find the perfect complimentary colour to align with their colour schemes. Hence, rather than fear , I feel people should feel excited to create new forms of art using this generation's new tools available to us, to hone our craft more.
